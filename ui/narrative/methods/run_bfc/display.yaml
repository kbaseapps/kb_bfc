    <p>
    This is a KBase wrapper for the
    <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bfc" target="_blank">BFC</a>
    Illumina short read error correction tool.
    </p>

    <p>
    BFC is a fast and easy-to-use sequencing error corrector designed for Illumina short reads.
    It uses a non-greedy algorithm but still maintains a speed comparable to implementations based on greedy methods.
    In evaluations on real data, BFC appears to correct more errors with fewer overcorrections in comparison
    to existing tools. It particularly does well in suppressing systematic sequencing errors, which helps
    to improve the base accuracy of de novo assemblies.
    </p>

    <p>
    BFC version: r181
    </p>

    <p>
    If the option to drop reads with unique kmers is selected, then any unpaired reads will also be removed.
    </p>
